## Packages

```{r pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(factoextra)
library(pheatmap)
library(tidyverse)
library(directlabels)
library(GGally)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Data

We usually think of high-dimensional data as consisting of multiple _measures_ on a group of samples:

* Number of "reads" of different bacterial proteins from a set of soil samples
* Decathlon scores from different competitors
* Health measures from different children

## Types of measures

Many scientists traditionally think of high-dimensional data as having parallel, continuous measures:

* read matrices from soil samples

These may be complemented by a smaller number of “metadata” variables, which may be more diverse in type (count, categorical, etc.):

* environmental variables associated with soil samples

More and more datasets don't follow this:

* Canadian longitudinal study on aging has a huge number of variables per person with a wide mixture of types

## Duality

We study the rows (samples) using the columns (measures)

* What do the observed proteins tell us about the functional relationships between different soil samples?
* What does differential success in decathlon events tell us about the athletes?

But we can also do the opposite!

* What do measurements across soil samples tell us about the functional relationships between proteins?
* What does differential success of athletes tell us about the relationship between events?

## Decathlon events

```{r events}
print(names(decathlon2))  ## from factoextra pkg
```

## Decathlon frame

```{r decathlon}
dec_frame <- (decathlon2[1:10]
        %>% as_tibble()
	%>% rename_all(sub, pattern="^X", replacement="Run_")
	%>% mutate_at(vars(contains('Run_')), ~(-1*.))
	%>% rename_all(sub, pattern="110m.", replacement="")
	%>% mutate_all(~c(drop(scale(.))))
)
```

## Pairs plot

![Iris pairs plot (iris.R)](iris.Rout.png)

---------------------

* Slow, and not very good for more than 5 or 6 variables
* Base R may be faster for quick viz

## Heatmap

```{r dec_heatmap}
dec_mat <- as.matrix(dec_frame)
heatmap(dec_mat)
```

## Heatmap again

```{r dec_t_heatmap}
heatmap(t(dec_mat))
```

## Correlation heatmap

```{r corr_heatmap}
pheatmap(cor(dec_mat), cell.width = 10, cell.height = 10)
```

Better for visualizing groups of  events

## Athelete correlations

```{r corr_athlete}
pheatmap(cor(t(dec_mat)), cell.width = 4, cell.height = 4)
```

Better for visualizing groups of  events

## PCA

A beautiful decomposition based on the idea that data points are points in a Euclidean space

* Need to think about scaling

We can think about the PCA as a decomposition (making observed points from idealized points)

* And relax it by requiring _non-negative_ combinations of _non-negative_ components (NMF)

Or we can think about it as minimizing distances:

* And relax it with non-Euclidean distances (PCoA)
* … or a rank-based approach (NMDS)

## PCA decomposition

```{r pca}
pca_ath <- prcomp(dec_mat, scale=TRUE)
fviz_screeplot(pca_ath)
```

## Individuals

```{r fviz_ind}
fviz_pca_ind(pca_ath)
```

## Components

```{r fviz_components}
fviz_pca_var(pca_ath)
```

--------------------

```{r fviz_altcomponents}
fviz_pca_var(pca_ath, axes=c(2, 3))
```

## Biplot

View scores and components:

```{r fviz_biplot}
fviz_pca_biplot(pca_ath)
```

## Loadings

```{r fviz_loadplot}
load <- with(pca_ath, 
	sweep(rotation, MARGIN=2, FUN="*", sdev)
)
pheatmap(load, cluster_cols=FALSE)
```

## Non-metric dimensional scaling

```{r nmds}
library(vegan)
mds <- metaMDS(dec_mat, distance="euclidean")
```

## Nmds plot

```{r nmds_plot}
plot(mds)
```

The biplot is hard (but we can help you if you want to do it)


## Parallel co-ordinates

```{r parcor}
GGally::ggparcoord(dec_frame)
```

## Dual view

```{r parcorath}
ath_frame <- (
	as.data.frame(t(as.matrix(dec_frame)))
	%>% mutate(event=names(dec_frame))
)
```

----------------------

```{r parcorathpic}
ggparcoord(ath_frame)
```

----------------------

```{r parcorgroup}
ggparcoord(ath_frame, groupColumn="event")
```

## Andrews plots

```{r andrews}
library(andrews)
## andrews::numarray() **does not like tibbles**
andrews(as.data.frame(dec_frame))
```
## dual Andrews plot

```{r andrews_ath}
andrews(ath_frame)
```

## Radar charts

Not implemented; may suffer similar problems

## Ordering

Many of these charts might work if the variables were in a suitable order:

* heatmap provides an order
	* hierarchical
* other ordering methods take a more holistic view

* PCA and other decompositions could also provide an order! 
	* Should we combine PCA with Andrews or parcoord?

## Experiment

```{r andrews_load}
andrews(load)
```

-----------------------

```{r parcoord_load}
ggparcoord(load)
```
