# Overview

## What are interactive graphics?

* Visualizations
* Combined with ways to click or hover and get more information
* e.g., the internet

## DataViz interactive goals

* Tell a clear story
* Allow viewers to see more than would be shown in two static dimensions
* Or to obtain more detailed information
* Or to explore things that go beyond the story you're telling

## Some interaction techniques

* Scaling and panning: allow viewers to look at different parts of an image
* Labelling: attach labels with detailed information
* Subsetting
	* Brushing: highlight categories by selecting them
	* Linking: link selections across several plots
	* Animation: selections in sequence; ideally can be played automatically or controlled by user

# Tools and resources

## Resources

* [Gap minder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/)
* [Gap minder and plotly](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-animated-charts-like-hans-rosling-doing-it-all-in-r-570efc6ba382)
* [Web book: Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny](https://plotly-r.com/)
* [htmlwidgets examples](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)

## Packages

* ggvis
	* Conceptually exciting (reworking of ggplot); dormant â˜¹
* googleVis
	* R interface to google charts: also fairly dormant
* plotly
	* Straightforward and popular (esp. via `ggplotly`)
* gganimate
    * very "gg" (grammar of graphics)-ish; not so interactive
* crosstalk
    * for letting different html widgets talk to each other (linking)
* leaflet
    * maps (more next week)

# More philosophy

## Acceptance

* Why don't people do this more?

* In what contexts can you reach an audience with interactive graphics?

* How can interactive graphics help you with your research?

# More

* [overview of animation](https://towardsdatascience.com/animating-your-data-visualizations-like-a-boss-using-r-f94ae20843e3) (`animate`, `gganimate`, `plotly`, `googleVis`)
* gapminder examples (especially [this version](https://github.com/keithmcnulty/hans_rosling_bubble/blob/master/rosling.R), somewhat modified by us [here](gapminder.R)
* wealth/tax/hovering example: @leonhardt_rich_2019, [code from David L. Miller](https://gist.github.com/dill/508532714cd58398aaf90a0723efd2fd), [our modifications](hover_tax.R)

# Software support

* different formats: 
    * JavaScript (underlies plotly, D3, Vega, highchartr, leaflet, ...)
	* GIF (old but supports animation)
	* MP4 (video format)
	* Flash (officially deprecated in favour of HTML5)
* be aware that you may need to install various extra software to render animations, or to play them
