# Overview

## What are interactive graphics?

* Visualizations
* Combined with ways to click or hover and get more information
* e.g., the internet

## DataViz interactive goals

* Tell a clear story
* Allow viewers to see more than would be shown in two static dimensions
* Or to obtain more detailed information
* Or to explore things that go beyond the story you're telling

## Some interaction techniques

* Scaling and panning: allow viewers to look at different parts of an image
* Labelling: attach labels with detailed information
* Subsetting
	* Brushing: highlight categories by selecting them
	* Linking: link selections across several plots
	* Animation: selections in sequence; ideally can be played automatically or controlled by user
