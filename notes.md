This is for JD and BB to communicate about how this page works and how it should work

# Links

Dumping, will clean later

# Appearance

I've spent way too much time on this, for reasons that are psychologically obscure. Feel free to chime in.

## css

There are a bunch of css files under styles, and there's a make rule that's meant to control which one is actually pushed to the pages. We can play with it some time (or you can play without me, but I'm no longer allowed to play without you).
* Oops, I did it again. I don't hate the current version, but I'm afraid you will.

## header and footer

These are also files which seem reasonably easy to look at. 

# Instructions

## Set up

```
git clone https://github.com/mac-theobio/DataViz.git
make Makefile
```

## Start working

```
make pull_all
```

## Add a markdown page

```
git add <name>.<ext>
```

<ext> should be .mkd (straight markdown), .rmd, or .Rmd. This should automatically add an .html to the pages branch when you finish the session

## Change a page

[Edit, save, commit]

## Force-push something

```
git add <name>.<ext>
make  <name>.<ext>.pages
```

## Testing

* `make ship_pages` to push to the LOCAL pages branch
* `make push_pages` to ship_pages and then push to the web

The testing part is terrible and is why we should switch to jekyll. Maybe next year. The local branch doesn't look right and pushing the web is slow and glitchy as we know

## Finish working

`make push_all` does push_pages and also pushes the master branch

# Architecture notes

.md should _never_ be involved in the web pathway, since it causes ambiguities. This also makes us free to use it for r-side pages like this one.

## Pipeline extensions

* .rmd and .Rmd are synonyms with the obvious meaning
* .mkd for simple markdown (e.g., index.mkd)
* .rwm for "raw" markdown (converted by rstudio (??)) that we don't like yet (the yaml problem that I always talk about but never document); these are intermediate files that we should try to ignore
* .rmk for patched, converted markdown; this then becomes a synonym for .mkd

* pages/*.html (automatically when .rmk can be made?)
* pages/*.ioslides.html (when requested and/or marked by Makefile?) _not implemented_
