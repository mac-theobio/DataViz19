  Abstract                 = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

This idea, termed effect-ordered data displays, applies principally to the arrangement of unordered factors for quantitative data and frequency data, and to the arrangement of variables and observations in multivariate displays (star plots, parallel coordinate plots, and so forth).

As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for ordering items, levels or variables “optimally”, based on some desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or singular-value decompositions.

Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by graphs—some surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly good—for showing patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions than we can provide answers for.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of graphical displays in statistical practice has been recognized sporadically in the statistical literature over the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis and Tufte's books in the succeeding decades. But statistical graphics still occupy an awkward in-between position: within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical principles. We present here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphic designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods. The purpose of this article is not to criticize but to explore the different goals that lead researchers in different fields to value different aspects of data visualization.},

  Abstract                 = {The boxplot has proven to be a very useful tool for summarizing univariate data. Several options of bivariate boxplot-type constructions are discussed. These include both elliptic and asymmetric plots. An inner region contains 50\% of the data, and a fence identifies potential outliers. Such a robust plot shows location, scale, correlation, and a resistant regression line. Alternative constructions are compared in terms of efficiency of the relevant parameters. Additional properties are given and recommendations made. Emphasis is given to the bivariate biweight M estimator. Several practical examples illustrate that standard least squares ellipsoids can give graphically misleading summaries.},

  Abstract                 = {Treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are a significant source of anthropogenic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, in the aquatic environment. Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O2 consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site. We discuss our findings in relation to exposure site water quality, concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care product pollutants, and our test species tolerance.},

The “depth median” is the deepest location, and it is surrounded by a “bag” containing the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the “fence” (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and MATLAB environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several datasets—for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate data.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models {(GLM)} and linear mixed models.},

  Abstract                 = {Echinoderm population collapses, driven by disease outbreaks and climatic events, may be important drivers of population dynamics, ecological shifts and biodiversity. The northeast Pacific recently experienced a mass mortality of sea stars. In Howe Sound, British Columbia, the sunflower star Pycnopodia helianthoides—a previously abundant predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates—began to show signs of a wasting syndrome in early September 2013, and dense aggregations disappeared from many sites in a matter of weeks. Here, we assess changes in subtidal community composition by comparing the abundance of fish, invertebrates and macroalgae at 20 sites in Howe Sound before and after the 2013 sea star mortality to evaluate evidence for a trophic cascade. We observed changes in the abundance of several species after the sea star mortality, most notably a four-fold increase in the number of green sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and a significant decline in kelp cover, which are together consistent with a trophic cascade. Qualitative data on the abundance of sunflower stars and green urchins from a citizen science database show that the patterns of echinoderm abundance detected at our study sites reflected wider local trends. The trophic cascade evident at the scale of Howe Sound was observed at half of the study sites. It remains unclear whether the urchin response was triggered directly, via a reduction in urchin mortality, or indirectly, via a shift in urchin distribution into areas previously occupied by the predatory sea stars. Understanding the ecological implications of sudden and extreme population declines may further elucidate the role of echinoderms in temperate seas, and provide insight into the resilience of marine ecosystems to biological disturbances.},

This paper shows that Excel graphics defaults do not embody the appropriate principles. Users who want to use Excel are advised to know the principles of good graphics well enough so that they can choose the appropriate options to override the defaults. Microsoft® should overhaul the Excel graphics engine so that its defaults embody the principles of statistical graphics and make it easy for non-experts to produce good graphs.},

Most researchers present comparisons of MCMC methods using tables of figures of merit; this paper presents a graphical alternative. It first discusses the computation of autocorrelation time, then uses this to construct a figure of merit, log density function evaluations per independent observation. Then, it demonstrates how one can plot this figure of merit against a tuning parameter in a grid of plots where columns represent sampling methods and rows represent distributions. This type of visualization makes it possible to convey a greater depth of information without overwhelming the user with numbers, allowing researchers to put their contributions into a broader context than is possible with a textual presentation.},

  Abstract                 = {Growth mixture models (GMMs) are used to model intra-individual change and inter-individual differences in change and to detect underlying group structure in longitudinal studies. Regularly, these models are fitted under the assumption of normality, an assumption that is frequently invalid. To this end, this thesis focuses on the development of novel non-elliptical growth mixture models to better fit real data. Two non-elliptical growth mixture models, via the multivariate skew-t distribution and the generalized hyperbolic distribution, are developed and applied to simulated and real data. Furthermore, these two non-elliptical growth mixture models are extended to accommodate missing values, which are near-ubiquitous in real data.

Recently, finite mixtures of non-elliptical distributions have flourished and facilitated the flexible clustering of the data featuring longer tails and asymmetry. However, in practice, real data often have missing values, and so work in this direction is also pursued. A novel approach, via mixtures of the generalized hyperbolic distribution and mixtures of the multivariate skew-t distributions, is presented to handle missing values in mixture model-based clustering context. To increase parsimony, families of mixture models have been developed by imposing constraints on the component scale matrices whenever missing data occur. Next, a mixture of generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers model is also proposed to cluster high-dimensional data with different patterns of missing values. Two missingness indicator matrices are also introduced to ease the computational burden. The algorithms used for parameter estimation are presented, and the performance of the methods is illustrated on simulated and real data.},

In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming.


* We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature.


* Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

	abstract = {We propose a rudimentary taxonomy of interactive data visualization based on a triad of data analytic tasks: finding Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations: focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization--XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking, and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections, linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots. Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking, and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by high-dimensional projections that form an extremely well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular interest are the illustration of asymptotic normality of high-dimensional projections (a theorem of Diaconis and Freedman), the use of high-dimensional cubes for visualizing factorial experiments, and a method for interactively generating matrices of conditional plots with high-dimensional projections. Although there is a unifying theme to this article, each section--in particular the case studies--can be read separately.},

This book will teach you 'cooking from scratch', from raw data to beautiful illuminating output, as you learn to write your own scripts in the R language and to use advanced statistics packages from CRAN and Bioconductor. It covers a broad range of basic and advanced topics important in the analysis of high-throughput biological data, including principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling, clustering, multiple testing, unsupervised and supervised learning, resampling, the pitfalls of experimental design, and power simulations using Monte Carlo, and it even reaches networks, trees, spatial statistics, image data, and microbial ecology. Using a minimum of mathematical notation, it builds understanding from well-chosen examples, simulation, visualization, and above all hands-on interaction with data and code.},

	abstract = {The R package colorspace provides a flexible toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in statistical graphics and data visualizations. In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space. Using the HCL color model general strategies for three types of palettes are implemented: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available. (2) Sequential for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from high to low (or vice versa). (3) Diverging for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes. To aid selection and application of these palettes the package also contains scales for use with ggplot2, shiny (and tcltk) apps for interactive exploration, visualizations of palette properties, accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation and lighten/darken), and emulation of color vision deficiencies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02015},
	abstract = {Research and development in computer science and statistics have produced increasingly sophisticated software interfaces for interactive and exploratory analysis, optimized for easy pattern finding and data exposure. But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently model-free and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems should enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference should be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},
