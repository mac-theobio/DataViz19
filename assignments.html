<h2 id="final-project">Final project</h2>
<p>Your final project will <em>probably</em> be done with a partner. The profs will help you pair up (and check with us if you really think you want to go alone).</p>
<p>The project should consist of an exploration of some data. There should be a consistent topic but you needn’t use only a single data file.</p>
<p>Your project should consist roughly of a brief description of the data set, and three or four well-thought-out visualizations (this is a guide, you could have a few as one really fancy one, or as many as ten simple ones that work really well together).</p>
<p>You should have a two-part writeup: the main text will be just the text necessary to support the story that you’re trying to tell, and there should be a methods part explaining briefly some of the visualization choices that you made, and if necessary briefly explaining decisions or cleanup things you had to do about the data.</p>
<p>Please submit your writeup as a pdf or html file by noon on [TBA]. Submit by pushing to your repository (ideally with all of the scripts used to construct the visualizations from raw data) and letting us know the name of the primary file.</p>
<h2 id="project-milestone">Project milestone</h2>
<p>Please submit a brief (0.5-2 pages) prospectus outlining what data you will use and some ideas about the story you wish to tell.</p>
<p>You should post this on a github repo. This can either be a directory in an existing repo, or a new repo to which one of you invites both of us (bbolker, dushoff) and your group members.</p>
<h2 id="week-1">week 1</h2>
<p>By the beginning of the first class period:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>make sure you can run RStudio (and R)</p></li>
<li><p>set up a GitHub account if necessary</p>
<ul>
<li>make an (empty except for a <code>README</code> file) repository called Stat744, and add <code>dushoff</code> and <code>bbolker</code> as collaborators</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>watch the Rausher video (see <a href="index.html">main page</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>read Sections 1-3 of <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">Wilke’s <em>Fundamentals of Data Visualization</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>email us to let us know you have finished, and to tell us your github username</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>For the first few weeks of the course, there will be a short assignment every week. These will be promulgated usually on Sunday, and you are advised to start before class on Monday. Assignments are technically due Friday at 16:30. This is to encourage you to finish quickly if you can, and move on with your life, not to give you pressure.</p>
<p>If your assignment will be late, please email us by Friday at 16:30 to let us know when you will hand it in. This should be before 16:30 on Monday, unless we give permission for special circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Submit your assignment by email</strong> to <a href="mailto:bio744DataViz@gmail.com">bio744DataViz@gmail.com</a>. Your assignment is not done until you do this.</p>
<!-- Comment
    See QMEE/ assignments for more text that we will want to adapt when we give them R assignments.
