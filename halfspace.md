\newcommand{\ldep}{\ensuremath\textrm{ldepth}(\theta,Z)\xspace}

The halfspace location depth \ldep of some point $\theta \in R^2$ relative to a bivariate data cloud $Z = {z_l, z_2, \dots, z_n}$ was introduced by Tukey (1975); see also Eddy (1985) and Green (1985). It is the smallest number of $z_i$ contained in any closed halfplane with boundary line through $\theta$. A time-efficient algorithm for \ldep was provided by Rousseeuw and Ruts (1996). The depth region $D_k$ is the set of all $\theta$ with $\ldep \ge k$, and was algorithmically constructed by Ruts and Rousseeuw (1996). The depth regions are convex polygons, and $D_{k+1} \subset D_k$. (Note that these regions are different from those generated by convex hull peeling, which first removes the vertices of the convex hull of the data cloud, then repeats this on the remainder of the dataset, and so on.)
